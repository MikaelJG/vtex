In this repo, all you need to insert latex examples in a plain text file.

1 - A .tex file, with sections -  \section{title}
  - With examples in verbatim  -  \begin{verbatim}
  - Ending with                -  \end{verbatim}

Like So:

    \section{Variables}
    
    \begin{verbatim}
        int: integers                   
        double: floating-point numbers
    \end{verbatim}


2 - Textract will extract you examples in a directory.
    
Like So:
    
    $ cat ./examples/variables

    int: integers                   
    double: floating-point numbers

3 - A keyword program copying the note in your current directory.

4 - A vim remap both running the keyword program and :r! the new note file.
